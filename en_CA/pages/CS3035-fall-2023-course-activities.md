# Contact, Activities and Dates

## Announcements

Teams will be used for class announcements. It is recommended that you turn on your teams notifications for the general channel, which will only accept posts by the instructor or TAs.

## Contact

- Email is the preferred method of contact with Scott: scottb atsign unb.ca
- Please allow up to one to two working days for response.
- Alternatively, you can contact me on Teams for more time-sensitive issues.
- Asking questions on Teams may also allow your classmates or TA to help with questions regarding technology or other clarifications. So, this is highly encouraged. Please use the appropriate channel in our class Team for your question.

## Class Times

See [class times on the course outline.](https://cs-3035-fall-2023.github.io/en_CA/#!pages/CS3035-fall-2023-syllabus.md#Class_Time_and_Location)

## Course Work Details

Below is an overview of the coursework.  

### Course Work and Marking Scheme (Tentative)

The grading scheme and number of items in the grade (in parentheses) is tentative and subject to small adjustments. See syllabus for details on missed or late work for assessment.

- Individual Assignments (3 assignments): 30%
- Group Video Presentation of Alternative UI Technology (1): 10% 
- JavaFX Individual Project: 20%
- Coding Tests (online/in-lab) (2 tests): 20% 
- Theory Tests (Theory Test) (2 tests): 20%

### Assignments

Assignments are larger and more challenging development tasks that aim to reinforce the theoretical topics in the course and give you hands-on practical experience in developing graphical user interfaces. 

Assignments should be completed using the course software (Java 8, IntelliJ, Git); see [Working with Git for Assignment and Examples] for more details.

### Group Video Presentation

The group video presentation will require you to independently research and learn the basics of an alternative UI technology for another language (other than Java). You will work with a group to create a short video presentation introducing the technology, its philosophy, and its basic use. You will also individually watch videos from other students in the class and prepare a short submission outlining what you have learned. A few videos will be selected for review in class. 

### Project

The project will be announced at the end of October and is self-directed. Criteria for assessment and example project ideas will be given. Note the grades associated with the project, so students should keep their expectations aligned with the provided criteria and example projects.

The project may be completed individually.

### Coding Tests

Coding tests will be completed as mini-assignments by coding answers to interface specifications and submitting your code to GitHub. These tests will test how well you have followed the course and understand your completed assignments. These tests are open-book but to be completed alone. The goal of the coding tests, just as a written test, is for you to demonstrate your understanding of how to solve a problem with code. However, working code is not a pre-requisite for full marks, but demonstrating that you understand how to solve the problem is (they are different). These may be done outside of the classroom online.

### Theory Tests

Theory tests will combine multiple-choice and short-answer questions.  You will complete them during class. The tests will cover any content covered in class, assignments or assigned (e.g., online readings). 

## Dates for Deliverables

**NOTE: All dates are tentative and are used as general targets.** Date adjustments will be made as needed, giving you additional time to avoid major conflicts. Adjustments to these dates will be announced in lectures.
