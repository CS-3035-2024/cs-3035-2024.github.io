### Assignments

Assignments are larger and somewhat more challenging development tasks that aim to reinforce the theoretical topics in the course and give you hands on practical experience in developing graphical user interfaces. 

Assignments should be completed using the course software (Java 8, IntelliJ, Git) see [Working with Git for Assignment and Examples] for more details.

### Group Video Presentation

The group video presentation will require you to independantly research, and learn the basics of an alternative UI technology for another language (other than Java). You will work with a group to create a short video presentation introducing the technology, its philosophy, and its basic use. You will also individually watch videos from other students in the class and prepare a short submission outlining what you have learned. A few videos will be selected for review in class. 

### Project

The project will be announced at the end of October and is meant to be a somewhat self-directed project. Criteria for assessment and example project ideas will be given. Note that the grades associated with the project, so students should keep their expectations in line with the provided criteria and example projects.

The project may be completed individually.
